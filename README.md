### INSTRUCTIONS
* Either use prefabs or create them on your own.
* You need an instance of Scene Manager in your starting point. This is mostly the Start Menu. Create a new game object named <Scene Manager> and attach the SceneManager script to it.
* Create a canvas and a start button. Attach the <Start Button> script to it.
* Make sure that your desired scenes are added to the build settings.
> To switch between scenes simply call this function => SceneManager.Instance.UpdateGameState(SceneState.Gameplay); You can add more scenes. To do this, get into the script and do the hard-coding.
